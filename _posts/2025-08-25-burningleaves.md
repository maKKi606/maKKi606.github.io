Passing aeons
Everlasting fight against the Evil
Their army grows on and on
With the darkening horizon

I'm not afraid, let them come
I will never retreat
I will stand and hold my ground
Protect the ancient tree
The defense is doomed to fall
With the world I used to know

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes
Crushed my dreams long gone

Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky
The flame within me is gone

On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die
