Though wounds were great, and respite scant
Life clung to that wretched plant
Its skin was scarred, its leaves were ripped
Damned to wait, as roots were fixed

For every hour, in hopeless fear
It felt them leave then draw back near
The insects drudged without a sound
And tore the plant down to the ground

Among them, one drone like any other
Stole away to meet another
Far from the swarm, the two had hidden
Their unborn child, which was forbidden

Spiteful mind and eyes unseen
Betrayed unto to a ruthless Queen
Condemned - the two would die alone
Their egg was cast on to the stones

An offering to slake the earth
Despite its lot, the child emerged
From hatching breath, its life was dire
In every dawn, the sky brought fire

It sought its kind, and as it roamed
Out of sight and far from home
A pack could see that, left alive
The child would lead them to the hive
