## Hi! 

I'm maKKi! I love creating stuff with my hands and expressing my ideas on paper (currently, it's on a tablet...)!

I like learning and trying out different things and me having a hundred hobbies is a consequence of those. Whenever I'm not drawing, I'm usually reading, gaming or tinkering with the computer. 

That's it!
