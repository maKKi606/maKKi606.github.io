Here's the lyrics of Against Widows by Amorphis:
The Devil weds a widowDeath another’s leftoversBetter to lie on a willowsRest on alder boughs
[Verse 2]
Then upon a widow’s bedOn a used woman’s pillowSweeter the side of a fenceThan a widow’s flank

[Chorus 1]
Sweeter the side of a fenceThan a widow’s flankSweeter the side of a fenceSofter the side of a groveThan a widow’s beside isSofter the side of a grove

[Verse 3]
The Devil weds a widowThe grave one twice wedA widow’s hand is rougherThan a dry spruce bough
[Verse 4]
With which she strikes the playfulGrabs the one who laughsA widow has had her gamesAnd spent a merry evening

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Sweeter the side of a fenceSweeter the side of a fenceSofter the side of a groveSofter the side of a grove

[Outro]
With which she strikes the playfulGrabs the one who laughsA widow has had her gamesAnd spent a merry evening
